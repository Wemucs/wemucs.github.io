# [Wemucs.com](//wemucs.com)

New platform for our blog, based on Jekyll and Github pages.

## To run on your own host

1 - Install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (sudo gem install jekyll`)
2 - Install Bundler if not already installed (`sudo gem install bundler`)
4 - Run: `bundle exec jekyll serve`

## Github-Pages

The Gemfile has been modified to use the 'github-pages' gem, to have a perfect render on your local host.

## Todo

- Pagination has not been integrated yet. To be done in the future.
